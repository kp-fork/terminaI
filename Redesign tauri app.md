## Refer first image:

1. Replace with the terminai banner at terminai-banner.svg (black small caps termina, red blinking capital I when light background; white  small caps termina, red blinking capital I when dark background). Also make the app have a logo that is Red capital I in console font
2. the text box at the bottom and the send button currently doesnt work. i.e., i am unable to type in it and send anything. same with the mic - it doesnt work. Also the planning and Claude opus thing you see at the bottom can be replaced with the /model, 
3. i want to make this a professional desktop app - so the top dark bar disappears and the white strip where you see antigravity and dark / light becomes the top bar... so as such it also needs the buttons ![[Pasted image 20251229105558.png]] after the light / dark icon. maybe after the light / dark icon also put a settings gear for now that can be wired to a full blown preferences window.
4. Make the top bar disappear and integrate into the bar for 3
5. make the pane windows resizable. if 5 cannot be resized make the right pane  go 1.5x wider
6. Make the pane window resizable
7. Settings - refer the next point i made

## Settings 


I pasted the two settings pane views here. 

1. the CLI settings should replicate the /settings in CLI... it currently appears to be a dummy and unclickable
2. The app settings is fine for now - but will change in next phase
