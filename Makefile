You are working on terminaI, a fork of gemini-cli located at /home/profharita/Code/termAI.

## What's Already Done (MVP)
Per tasks.md section "1. Current State":
- terminaI identity and "General Terminal Tasks" workflows in prompts.ts
- Node-derived system snapshot in environmentContext.ts
- Process Manager Tool implemented with full API (start/list/status/read/send/signal/stop)
- Unit tests for process-manager.ts

## Your Task: Build, Test, and Verify

### Step 1: Build
cd /home/profharita/Code/termAI
npm ci
npm run build

### Step 2: Run Tests
npm run test:ci --workspace @google/gemini-cli-core

### Step 3: Interactive Verification
Start the CLI:
npm run start

Then manually test these flows:
1. "What's eating my CPU?" - should inspect system and summarize
2. "How much disk do I have?" - should run df/du and report
3. "Start `node -e 'setInterval(() => console.log(Date.now()), 1000)'` as `ticker`" - tests Process Manager
4. "Show me the last 10 lines from `ticker`"
5. "Stop `ticker`" - should ask for confirmation
6. "What's the weather in Austin?" - tests web search

### Step 4: Fix Any Issues
If tests fail or verification doesn't work, debug and fix.

### Step 5: Report Results
After verification, summarize:
- Build status
- Test results (pass/fail count)
- Each manual verification result
- Any bugs found and fixed

Read tasks.md for full context. Good luck.
