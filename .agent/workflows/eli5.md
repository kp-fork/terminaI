# ELI5 - Explain Like I'm 5 (Business Edition)

When the user asks for an explanation or invokes /eli5:

1. **Strip all jargon** - Replace technical terms with plain language
2. **State the problem directly** - What is broken, slow, or wrong?
3. **State the cause directly** - Why is it happening?
4. **State the fix directly** - What needs to change?
5. **No analogies** - Describe the actual system, not metaphors
6. **Keep it under 100 words** unless complexity demands more

## Format

```
**Problem:** [What's wrong in one sentence]

**Cause:** [Why it's happening in one sentence]

**Fix:** [What to do about it in one sentence]

**Trade-offs:** [Optional - what you gain vs what you lose]
```
