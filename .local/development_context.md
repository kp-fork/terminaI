# TerminaI Development Context (Private)

## Current State

- Tool is slow, not extremely smart, not always successful
- Must improve before public release

## The Testing Problem

- Can't improve without knowing how it performed across numerous interactions
- Only one tester (user) who doesn't have time to test while also coding

## The Vision

- An agent asking TerminaI millions of questions day in/day out
- Use these interactions for mass analysis and improvement
- Human triggers actual code improvements
- All facts available to human to understand what happened and why

## Key Insight

The logging + evaluation system is not just for debugging — it's the foundation
for **autonomous self-improvement at scale**.
