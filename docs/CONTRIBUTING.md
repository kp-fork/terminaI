# Contributing to TerminaI

TerminaI is a community-built AI terminal with governed autonomy for laptops and
servers.

We’re optimizing for **contributors** right now. If you want to build the future
of trustworthy system automation (A2A, MCP, policy gating, PTY hardening, audit
logs), you’re in the right place.

## Quick start (dev setup)

**Prereqs:** Node.js `>=20`, Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prof-Harita/terminaI.git
cd terminaI
npm ci
npm run build

# Link the launcher
npm link --workspace packages/termai

# Run
terminai
```

See also: `docs-terminai/quickstart.md`.

## Where to contribute (pick a lane)

High-impact areas (with suggested entry points):

1. **Governance / Safety** — approvals, trust boundaries, policy ladder
   - start: `packages/core/src/safety/`, `packages/core/src/policy/`
2. **PTY hardening (Desktop System Operator)** — resize, exit status,
   backpressure, signals
   - start: `packages/desktop/src-tauri/src/pty_session.rs`
3. **Auditability** — audit log + user-visible action history
   - start: `docs/security-posture.md`,
     `packages/core/src/telemetry/sanitize.ts`
4. **MCP ecosystem** — new powers via MCP servers
   - start: `docs/tools/mcp-server.md`
5. **A2A protocol + clients** — drive TerminaI from IDE/GUI/scripts
   - start: `packages/a2a-server/`, `docs-terminai/web-remote.md`

## How to contribute (process)

1. Pick an issue (or open one).
2. Fork the repo, create a branch.
3. Make a focused change.
4. Run validators (see below).
5. Open a PR.

### PR hygiene

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Link to an issue where possible.
- Add/adjust tests when behavior changes.
- Avoid drive-by refactors.

## Validators

Fast local checks:

```bash
npm test --workspaces --if-present
```

If you’re changing linted areas:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Full preflight (slow):

```bash
npm run preflight
```

  - `core/`: The core backend logic for the Gemini CLI.
  - `test-utils` Utilities for creating and cleaning temporary file systems for
    testing.
  - `vscode-ide-companion/`: The Gemini CLI Companion extension pairs with
    Gemini CLI.
- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building, testing, and development tasks.

For more detailed architecture, see `docs/architecture.md`.

### Debugging

#### VS Code

0.  Run the CLI to interactively debug in VS Code with `F5`
1.  Start the CLI in debug mode from the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run debug
    ```
    This command runs `node --inspect-brk dist/gemini.js` within the
    `packages/cli` directory, pausing execution until a debugger attaches. You
    can then open `chrome://inspect` in your Chrome browser to connect to the
    debugger.
2.  In VS Code, use the "Attach" launch configuration (found in
    `.vscode/launch.json`).

Alternatively, you can use the "Launch Program" configuration in VS Code if you
prefer to launch the currently open file directly, but 'F5' is generally
recommended.

To hit a breakpoint inside the sandbox container run:

```bash
DEBUG=1 gemini
```

**Note:** If you have `DEBUG=true` in a project's `.env` file, it won't affect
gemini-cli due to automatic exclusion. Use `.terminai/.env` files for gemini-cli
specific debug settings.

### React DevTools

To debug the CLI's React-based UI, you can use React DevTools. Ink, the library
used for the CLI's interface, is compatible with React DevTools version 4.x.

1.  **Start the Gemini CLI in development mode:**

    ```bash
    DEV=true npm start
    ```

2.  **Install and run React DevTools version 4.28.5 (or the latest compatible
    4.x version):**

    You can either install it globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g react-devtools@4.28.5
    react-devtools
    ```

    Or run it directly using npx:

    ```bash
    npx react-devtools@4.28.5
    ```

    Your running CLI application should then connect to React DevTools.

### Sandboxing

#### macOS Seatbelt

On macOS, `terminai` uses Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) under a `permissive-open`
profile (see `packages/cli/src/utils/sandbox-macos-permissive-open.sb`) that
restricts writes to the project folder but otherwise allows all other operations
and outbound network traffic ("open") by default. You can switch to a
`restrictive-closed` profile (see
`packages/cli/src/utils/sandbox-macos-restrictive-closed.sb`) that declines all
operations and outbound network traffic ("closed") by default by setting
`SEATBELT_PROFILE=restrictive-closed` in your environment or `.env` file.
Available built-in profiles are `{permissive,restrictive}-{open,closed,proxied}`
(see below for proxied networking). You can also switch to a custom profile
`SEATBELT_PROFILE=<profile>` if you also create a file
`.terminai/sandbox-macos-<profile>.sb` under your project settings directory
(`.terminai`; legacy `.gemini` is still read).

#### Container-based sandboxing (all platforms)

For stronger container-based sandboxing on macOS or other platforms, you can set
`TERMINAI_SANDBOX=true|docker|podman|<command>` in your environment or `.env`
file. The specified command (or if `true` then either `docker` or `podman`) must
be installed on the host machine. Once enabled, `npm run build:all` will build a
minimal container ("sandbox") image and `npm start` will launch inside a fresh
instance of that container. The first build can take 20-30s (mostly due to
downloading of the base image) but after that both build and start overhead
should be minimal. Default builds (`npm run build`) will not rebuild the
sandbox.

Container-based sandboxing mounts the project directory (and system temp
directory) with read-write access and is started/stopped/removed automatically
as you start/stop Gemini CLI. Files created within the sandbox should be
automatically mapped to your user/group on host machine. You can easily specify
additional mounts, ports, or environment variables by setting
`SANDBOX_{MOUNTS,PORTS,ENV}` as needed. You can also fully customize the sandbox
for your projects by creating the files `.terminai/sandbox.Dockerfile` and/or
`.terminai/sandbox.bashrc` under your project settings directory (`.terminai`;
legacy `.gemini` is still read) and running `terminai` with `BUILD_SANDBOX=1` to
trigger building of your custom sandbox (the `gemini` alias is still supported).

#### Proxied networking

All sandboxing methods, including macOS Seatbelt using `*-proxied` profiles,
support restricting outbound network traffic through a custom proxy server that
can be specified as `TERMINAI_SANDBOX_PROXY_COMMAND=<command>`, where
`<command>` must start a proxy server that listens on `:::8877` for relevant
requests. See `docs/examples/proxy-script.md` for a minimal proxy that only
allows `HTTPS` connections to `example.com:443` (e.g.
`curl https://example.com`) and declines all other requests. The proxy is
started and stopped automatically alongside the sandbox.

### Manual publish

If you need to manually cut a local build, then run the following commands:

```
npm run clean
npm install
npm run auth
npm run prerelease:dev
npm publish --workspaces
```

## Documentation contribution process

Our documentation must be kept up-to-date with our code contributions. We want
our documentation to be clear, concise, and helpful to our users. We value:

- **Clarity:** Use simple and direct language. Avoid jargon where possible.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure all information is correct and up-to-date.
- **Completeness:** Cover all aspects of a feature or topic.
- **Examples:** Provide practical examples to help users understand how to use
  Gemini CLI.

### Getting started

The process for contributing to the documentation is similar to contributing
code.

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2. **Make your changes** in the `/docs` directory.
3. **Preview your changes locally** in Markdown rendering.
4. **Lint and format your changes.** Our preflight check includes linting and
   formatting for documentation files.
   ```bash
   npm run preflight
   ```
5. **Open a pull request** with your changes.

### Documentation structure

Our documentation is organized using [sidebar.json](/docs/sidebar.json) as the
table of contents. When adding new documentation:

1. Create your markdown file **in the appropriate directory** under `/docs`.
2. Add an entry to `sidebar.json` in the relevant section.
3. Ensure all internal links use relative paths and point to existing files.

### Style guide

We follow the
[Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
Please refer to it for guidance on writing style, tone, and formatting.

#### Key style points

- Use sentence case for headings.
- Write in second person ("you") when addressing the reader.
- Use present tense.
- Keep paragraphs short and focused.
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting.
- Include practical examples whenever possible.

### Linting and formatting

We use `prettier` to enforce a consistent style across our documentation. The
`npm run preflight` command will check for any linting issues.

You can also run the linter and formatter separately:

- `npm run lint` - Check for linting issues
- `npm run format` - Auto-format markdown files
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues where possible

Please make sure your contributions are free of linting errors before submitting
a pull request.

### Before you submit

Before submitting your documentation pull request, please:

1. Run `npm run preflight` to ensure all checks pass.
2. Review your changes for clarity and accuracy.
3. Check that all links work correctly.
4. Ensure any code examples are tested and functional.
