**TermAI** is the next-generation, general-purpose terminal agent. While it
excels at coding, it is **not just a coding agent**.

It is a bridge between natural language and the unlimited power of the command
line, designed for **everyone**—from the layman asking about the weather to the
sysadmin managing a server fleet.

Forked and upgraded from Gemini CLI.

## 🚀 Why TermAI?

Most "agents" (like OpenCode or Claude Code) act like senior engineers. **TermAI
acts like a universal translator for your computer.**

- **🌍 For Everyone**:
  - _Layman:_ "What is the weather in Tokyo?" -> Fetches real-time data.
  - _Business User:_ "Send an email to the team with these meeting notes." ->
    Automates communication.
  - _Power User:_ "Find all large files >1GB and compress them." -> Orchestrates
    system operations.
- **🗣️ Voice-First**: Hands-free interactions with `space` or `ctrl+space`
  Push-to-Talk.
- **⚡ YOLO Mode**: Autonomous execution. "Fix the build" or "Organize my
  downloads folder" without nagging.
- **🌐 Web Remote**: Control your terminal from a browser/iPad.
- **🔧 Extensible**: Built on MCP (Model Context Protocol). If you can script
  it, TermAI can use it.

## ✊ Our Mission

We are committed to building the most extensible natural language terminal
superpower known to mankind.

1.  **Always Free & Open Source**: No gatekeeping. No paid binaries.
2.  **For Users, By Power Users**: Built by developers who live in the terminal,
    for everyone.
3.  **Maximum Extensibility**: If you can dream it (or script it), TermAI should
    be able to do it.

## 📦 Installation

### From Source (Recommended for now)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prof-Harita/termAI.git
cd termAI
npm ci
npm run build
npm link --workspace packages/cli
```

You can now run `gemini` (alias) or use the `termAI` binary once we publish.

## 🔐 Authentication Options

Choose the authentication method that best fits your needs:

### Option 1: Login with Google (OAuth login using your Google Account)

**✨ Best for:** Individual developers as well as anyone who has a Gemini Code
Assist License. (see
[quota limits and terms of service](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/quotas)
for details)

**Benefits:**

- **Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** with 1M token context window
- **No API key management** - just sign in with your Google account
- **Automatic updates** to latest models

#### Start Gemini CLI, then choose _Login with Google_ and follow the browser authentication flow when prompted

```bash
gemini
```

#### If you are using a paid Code Assist License from your organization, remember to set the Google Cloud Project

```bash
# Set your Google Cloud Project
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
gemini
```

### Option 2: Gemini API Key

**✨ Best for:** Developers who need specific model control or paid tier access

**Benefits:**

- **Free tier**: 100 requests/day with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Model selection**: Choose specific Gemini models
- **Usage-based billing**: Upgrade for higher limits when needed

```bash
# Get your key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
gemini
```

### Option 3: Vertex AI

**✨ Best for:** Enterprise teams and production workloads

**Benefits:**

- **Enterprise features**: Advanced security and compliance
- **Scalable**: Higher rate limits with billing account
- **Integration**: Works with existing Google Cloud infrastructure

```bash
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
gemini
```

For Google Workspace accounts and other authentication methods, see the
[authentication guide](./docs/get-started/authentication.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
gemini
```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
gemini --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Use specific model

```bash
gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json
```

For real-time event streaming (useful for monitoring long-running operations),
use `--output-format stream-json` to get newline-delimited JSON events:

```bash
gemini -p "Run tests and deploy" --output-format stream-json
```

### Quick Examples

#### Start a new project

```bash
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
cd gemini-cli
gemini
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
