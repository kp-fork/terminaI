## A. the settings in side bar are not really settings
Please refer image below
1. I dont see the actual recipes, I only see the list recipes
2. once clicked it starts a process that never completes
3. and returns nothing in the chat bar

Instead i just want the recipes listed in the sidebar

## B. No placeholders please. I need real functionality as i asked for explicitly above
The following sectons are filled only with placeholders (going from bottom icon to top):
1. Account... both dummy placeholders and just one "Sign in"
2. preferences last icon  
3. terminal


## C. Still weak
The following have barely 3-6 settings that look too weak to have a dedicated sidebar button. Have you genuinely gone through all possible settings?
